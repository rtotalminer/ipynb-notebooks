    "# Generation Of Primes\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The notebook was made to better my understanding of algorithmically generating primes and how to iteraviley improve an algorithm.\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "For relatively small numbers, it is possible to just apply trial division to each successive odd number. Prime sieves are almost always faster. Prime sieving is the fastest known way to deterministically enumerate the primes. There are some known formulas that can calculate the next prime but there is no known way to express the next prime in terms of the previous primes. Also, there is no effective known general manipulation and/or extension of some mathematical expression (even such including later primes) that deterministically calculates the next prime.\n",

    "## Trial Division\n",
    "Trial division was first described by Fibonacci in his book Liber Abaci (1202).\n",
    "\n",
    "Trial division is the most laborious but easiest to understand of the integer factorization algorithms. The essential idea behind trial division tests to see if an integer *n*, the integer to be factored, can be divided by each number in turn that is less than *n*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "Given an integer n (n refers to \"the integer to be factored\"), the trial division consists of systematically testing whether n is divisible by any smaller number. Clearly, it is only worthwhile to test candidate factors less than n, and in order from two upwards because an arbitrary n is more likely to be divisible by two than by three, and so on. With this ordering, there is no point in testing for divisibility by four if the number has already been determined not divisible by two, and so on for three and any multiple of three, etc. Therefore, the effort can be reduced by selecting only prime numbers as candidate factors. Furthermore, the trial factors need go no further than ${\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {\\sqrt {n}}}$ because, if *n* is divisible by some number *p*, then $n = p \\times q $ and if *q* were smaller than *p*, *n* would have been detected earlier as being divisible by *q* or by a prime factor of *q*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A definite bound on the prime factors is possible. Suppose $ P_i $ is the i'th prime, so that $ P_1 = 2 $, $ P_2 = 3 $, $P_3 = 5$, etc. Then the last prime number worth testing as a possible factor of *n* is $P_i$ where $P_{2i} + 1 > n$; equality here would mean that $P_i + 1 $ is a factor. Thus, testing with 2, 3, and 5 suffices up to  $n = 48$ not just 25 because the square of the next prime is 49, and below n = 25 just 2 and 3 are sufficient. Should the square root of *n* be an integer, then it is a factor and *n* is a perfect square."

    "These versions of trial division are guaranteed to find a factor of n if there is one since they check all possible factors of n â€” and if n is a prime number, this means trial factors all the way up to n. Thus, if the algorithm finds one factor only, n, it is proof that n is a prime. If more than one factor is found, then n is a composite integer. A more computationally advantageous way of saying this is, if any prime whose square does not exceed n divides it without a remainder, then n is not prime.\n",
